Ern==Bob. How's things?

Bob==Good thanks buddy. Beautiful day here. Another severe blue day on the east coast.

Ern==Right - 11-Sep. Dunno how I didn't think about that before pinging you.

Bob==No problems. All very quiet here so many years after....

Bob==So, I'm guessing you'd like to know what I found about the @man?

Ern==Yep. I've come up pretty dry from the Brits and French. I'm as dumbfounded as my nephew on this one.

Bob==I've joined the dumbfounded club. The TLD and the 11 class A bits are real, no doubt. But, the whole event went unnoticed by my old TLA.. by everyone, from what I can tell.

Ern==That's not a response I expected. You had anything as blank-page as this one before??

Bob==Nope - Ernster, if it wasn't you, I'd be writing this off as a prank. But you say the young fella is solid?

Ern==Solid as can be. He's no patriot, but a very steady head on his shoulders. There's an interesting boss in his life, Pak Lim... something of a sage in the tech world....

Bob==Yeah, I remember him. Did a bunch of stuff with the cell tower hand off as I recall....

Ern==That's the guy. I think he's philosophically a bit of a radical, but only in the Totally Subjectivity sense.

Bob==ok

Ern==I'm not going to push my nephew about this doco and symmetric secrets... I could do a flight to Sydney and have a look in person. The fact that you haven't found a government program on this is pretty concerning to me.

Bob==Doesn't reek of ru or ch though - plus the access? I'm not so concerned about the network 11 route, but the TLD? I can't even guess at how that is possible. Oh, as you'd guess - nothing from NSA either re: new forms of key mgt/exchange.

Ern==... Bob, I had some weird kind of blackout earlier. Woke up asleep on my keyboard and feeling like I'd fallen off a cliff. I'm gonna get myself checked out and head down to Sydney if all is well. There might be something real here. I've gotta know.

Bob==Jaysus Ern, are you sure you're up for that? Last time I checked, you weren't getting any younger.

Ern==It was very strange. I had a 'glass darkly' moment when I woke up and went to the bathroom. My reflection...

Bob==...was?

Ern==Not me. A young woman with long hair.

Ern==

Ern==Bob?

Bob==Can you put me in touch with someone on the ground that you trust, who can let me know if things go the way of the pear for you?

Ern==

Ern==My sister. I'll send you a contact card and let her know what's going on.

Bob==Alright brother - get yourself right and get in touch whenever you need to. Same protocols.

Ern==Thanks Bob. Talk soon.
