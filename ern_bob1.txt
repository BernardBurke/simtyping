Ern==Bob. How's things?

Bob==Good thanks buddy. Beautiful day here. Another severe blue day on the east coast.


Ern==Right - 11-Sep. Dunno how I didn't think about that before pinging you.

Bob==No problems. All very quiet here so many years after....


Bob==So, I'm guessing you'd like to know what I found about the @man?

Ern==Yep. I've come up pretty dry from the Brits and French. I'm as dumbfounded as my nephew on this one.

Bob==I've joined the dumbfounded club. The TLD and the 11 class A bits are real, no doubt. But, the whole event went unnoticed by my old TLA.. by everyone, from what I can tell.


Ern==That's not a response I expected. You had anything as blank-page as this one before.


Bob==Nope - Ernster, if it wasn't you, I'd be writing this off as a prank. But you say the young fella is solid?


Ern==Solid as can be. He's no patriot, but a very steady head on his shoulders. There's an interesting boss in his life, Pak Lim... something of a sage in the tech world....

Bob==Yeah, I remember him. Did a bunch of stuff with the cell tower hand off as I recall....


Ern==That's the guy. I think he's philosophically a bit of a radical, but only in the Totally Subjectivity sense.
